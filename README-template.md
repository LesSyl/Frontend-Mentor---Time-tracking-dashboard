### What I learned

In this challenge, I worked on creating responsive websites, which gave me a better understanding of techniques for adapting a website's appearance to different device resolutions. I also learned how to add my own fonts using @font-face, which gives me more freedom to customise the aesthetics of the site. The main issues I have mastered are methods to prevent the page from reloading, so that the user can use the site smoothly. In addition, I have explored the principles of correct form validation, which allows for effective protection of user data and better management of errors when entering information.
